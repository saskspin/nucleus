The University of Saskatchewan has a long tradition of research excellence in subatomic physics.
This research was primarily associated with the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory (SAL) which
was founded in 1963. Internationally recognized contributions were made by the SAL research team
in such areas as nuclear Compton scattering, multi-nucleon photo-emission, pion photo-production,
and few-body physics. This experimental program, which began around 1990, determined fundamental
nuclear and nucleon properties and processes by bombarding nuclei with high energy gamma
rays. Midway through this program, and in spite of excellent peer reviews, SAL was informed by
NSERC that funding was to disappear and the laboratory was to be decommissioned. At the same
time, the Canadian Light Source (synchrotron) proposal was rapidly advancing, although this was
unrelated to the SAL shutdown. The final SAL experiment was completed on March 29, 1999,
and the accelerator was shutdown. Coincidentally, within days of shutdown, the CFI (Canadian
Foundation for Innovation) funding for the Canadian Light Source (CLS) was announced. The
subatomic physics program at SAL, however, was finished.
It is not possible to continue, at the CLS, the research formerly conducted at SAL. The CLS
facility is a stand-alone operation solely devoted to the provision of synchrotron light to the research
community. This “light” is not appropriate for nuclear research since the nuclear program
requires high-energy gamma rays, while the synchrotron provides visible light and low-energy Xrays.
Furthermore, the present linear accelerator, which forms part of the injection system for the
synchrotron, cannot be used to do subatomic physics research since the accelerator has been modified
to suit the synchrotron, making it totally incompatible with any subatomic physics program.
The accelerator must also be prepared to deliver electrons to the synchrotron on a moments notice,
which would make any secondary application impossible.
